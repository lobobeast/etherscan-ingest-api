# etherscan-ingest-api
Repo housing the API that ingests the etherscan eAPI

Create a '.env' file in your local repo with the following code structure:
```
API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Run this service locally via the 'npm start' command in your terminal.

I recommend using Postman to call your API.
